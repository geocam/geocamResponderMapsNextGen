This repository is a place to try out next-generation web app
technologies such as JavaScript MVC frameworks (example: Ember.js or
Backbone) and packaging technologies that give web apps access to native
app APIs (example: PhoneGap).
As a test case, we are porting an existing app under development,
geocamResponderMaps (<a href="http://github.com/geocam/geocamResponderMaps">http://github.com/geocam/geocamResponderMaps</a> ), to
use the new toolchain.  Some of the code developed in this repo may
eventually be migrated to the main-line implementation.
This is currently a project developed by two interns as part of
the GeoCam Project during summer 2012.
